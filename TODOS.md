# TODO's :
  - Add http request for data fetch on submit (api: https://spectrocoin.com/scapi/ticker/BTC/EUR)
  - Add timer to request data every 1min
  - Update amount equivalents automatically every 1min + after submit
  - BTC input field must contain only numeric values and show correct errors
  - Loader would be nice
  - Fix issue with multiple rendering of the listed items and logic inside of it
